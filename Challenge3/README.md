A system that allow's you to remotely access and control a luminaire (lighting	device) from home	(i.e.	via	internet	access). For the purpose we will use LEDs attached to the Arduino as a proxy for a luminaire. Remote control consists of turning the LEDs on the board on or off from a remote	
computer.
