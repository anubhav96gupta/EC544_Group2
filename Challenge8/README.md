A system that drives a vehicle through an indoor course without operator (human) control. The system leverage's the control strategies for driving the collision avoidance and indoor positioning. It provide's a real time data stream using webcam including position information that should be displayed on a remote computer
console illustrating position information of your vehicle. The system allow's a human to take control of the vehicle remotely.

The following solutions are Integrated : 

• Autonomous driving and collision avoidance using provided sensors, speed control and servo steering

• Indoor location sensing and reporting to a base station to log location information at the base station

• Real-time visualization of position based on logged information, displayed at a remote terminal

• Remote control from a disparate IP network to permit course corrections and safety features and to take over control of vehicle

• First-person video streaming from the crawler to the remote site where the crawler is being controlled
